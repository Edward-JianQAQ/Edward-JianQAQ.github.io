**[üìÑ Download my CV](../files/CV_Xiangru_Jian_latest.pdf)**

I am a PhD student in [Data System Group](https://uwaterloo.ca/data-systems-group/) at the [Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the University of Waterloo. I am so fortunate to be advised by Prof. [M. Tamer √ñzsu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~tozsu/). I am also a visiting researcher at [ServiceNow Research](https://www.servicenow.com/research/author/xiangru-jian.html). My research is on LLM applications for data management, which generally consists of two parts, 1) Structured or Semi-structured data like relational tables and knowledge graphs, and 2) Unstructured data like images and videos. I did my master degree in Data Science at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.ds.cityu.edu.hk/), advised by Prof. [Yu Yang](https://yuyangcs.github.io/), working on data mining and graph learning. One thing needs to be mentioned here: I am a big fan of [Manchester City FC](https://www.mancity.com/).
